## Amazon Prime Video 1080p

A Chrome Extension that forces 1080p resolution for videos on Amazon Prime Video to be applied

## How does it work?
~~The script loaded on Amazon Prime Video determines the quality of the video by the size of the browser window, so it just rewrites it on page load.~~

Rewrites the Media Presentation Description (MPD) used for video streaming and replaces it with the highest quality video.

#### Note: I have done a lot of research on the problem of not being able to play HD videos on Linux, but have not found a solution.

## Information
So far, not sure if the script will work on amazon.com.
So If you are someone who can edit the source code, try that yourself please.

Also, I accept issues, so please feel free to open an issue!

## Check

- Not all videos on Amazon Prime Video are 1080p. Some of the original videos themselves are 720p (not 1080p), in which case they are HD.

- If the video is not in 1080p, try seeking the video
